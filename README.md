# Machine Learning- Unsupervised Learning: Mental-Health-In-Tech

## Summary

### This project explores the analysis and visualization of mental health-related data within a workplace setting. The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

    1. **Data Preprocessing: We performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and preparing the dataset for analysis.**

    2. **Clustering Analysis: Utilizing clustering algorithms, we grouped employees based on various mental health attributes and their workplace-related factors.**

    3. **Visualizations: Visualizations were generated to analyze the clustered data, showcasing the distribution of categorical features within each cluster.**

    4. **Evaluation: The quality of the clusters was evaluated using the Silhouette Score, which measures the cohesion and separation of clusters.**
